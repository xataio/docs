description: Interact with Xata programmatically using our REST API
---

The Xata REST API allows you to programmatically manage your databases, branches, and data. All API endpoints are available at `https://api.xata.tech`.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. You can create API keys in the [Xata dashboard](https://app.xata.io). Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.xata.tech/...
```

## Available Endpoints

The API is organized into the following sections:

### Organizations

- [List organizations](/api/organizations#list-organizations)
- [Get organization details](/api/organizations#get-organization)
- [Update organization](/api/organizations#update-organization)
- [Delete organization](/api/organizations#delete-organization)

### Projects

- [List projects](/api/projects#list-projects)
- [Create project](/api/projects#create-project)
- [Get project details](/api/projects#get-project)
- [Update project](/api/projects#update-project)
- [Delete project](/api/projects#delete-project)
- [Get available regions](/api/projects#get-regions)

### Branches

- [List branches](/api/branches#list-branches)
- [Create branch](/api/branches#create-branch)
- [Get branch details](/api/branches#get-branch)
- [Update branch](/api/branches#update-branch)
- [Delete branch](/api/branches#delete-branch)

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `201 Created`: A new resource was successfully created
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or is missing
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist
- `5XX`: Server error

Error responses include a JSON object with a `message` field describing the error:

```json
{
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 1000 requests per hour per API key

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed per time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time when the current rate limit window resets (Unix timestamp)
