description: Learn how to use Xata's branching and migration features for zero-downtime deployments
---

This guide walks through a typical developer workflow using Xata's branching and migration features. We'll cover:

- Setting up your development environment
- Creating and managing branches
- Making schema changes
- Testing changes in isolation
- Deploying to production

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Xata account (sign up at [console.xata.io](https://console.xata.io))
2. The Xata CLI installed:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://xata.io/install.sh | bash
   ```
3. Authenticated with Xata:
   ```bash
   xata auth login
   ```

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   xata init
   ```

2. Create your first branch:
   ```bash
   xata branch create main
   ```

3. Initialize your database schema:
   ```bash
   xata init
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Create a new branch for your feature:

```bash
xata branch create feature/new-column
```

This creates an isolated copy of your database where you can safely make changes.

### 2. Make Schema Changes

Edit your schema file (e.g., `schema.json`) to add your changes. For example, adding a new column:

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "users",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "email",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "last_login",
          "type": "datetime"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Apply Changes

Apply your schema changes to the feature branch:

```bash
xata branch apply
```

This will:
- Validate your schema changes
- Apply the changes to your feature branch
- Show you a preview of the changes

### 4. Test Your Changes

Your application can now connect to the feature branch and test the changes:

```bash
xata branch url
```

Use the URL to connect your application to the feature branch.

### 5. Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy:

1. Merge your changes to main:
   ```bash
   xata branch merge main
   ```

2. Apply the changes to production:
   ```bash
   xata branch apply --branch main
   ```

The changes will be applied with zero downtime, and your application can continue running during the migration.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use branches** for development work
2. **Test thoroughly** in your feature branch before merging
3. **Review schema changes** before applying to production
4. **Use meaningful branch names** that describe the changes
5. **Keep branches up to date** with main to avoid conflicts

## Common Commands

- List branches: `xata branch list`
- Switch branches: `xata branch switch <name>`
- Delete branches: `xata branch delete <name>`
- View branch status: `xata branch status`
- Get branch URL: `xata branch url`
