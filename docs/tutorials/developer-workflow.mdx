description: Learn how to use Xata's branching and migration features for zero-downtime deployments
---

This guide walks through a typical developer workflow using Xata's branching and migration features. We'll cover:

- Setting up your development environment
- Creating and managing branches
- Making schema changes
- Testing changes in isolation
- Deploying to production

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Xata account (sign up at [console.xata.io](https://console.xata.io))
2. The Xata CLI installed:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://xata.io/install.sh | bash
   ```
3. Authenticated with Xata:
   ```bash
   xata auth login
   ```

## Initial setup

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   xata init
   ```

2. Create your first branch:
   ```bash
   xata branch create main
   ```

3. Initialize your database schema:
   ```bash
   xata init
   ```

## Development workflow

### 1. Create a feature branch

Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   xata branch create feature/new-column
   ```

This creates an isolated copy of your database where you can safely make changes.

### 2. Make schema changes

Edit your schema file (e.g., `schema.json`) to add your changes. For example, adding a new column:

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "users",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "email",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "age",
          "type": "integer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Apply changes

Apply your schema changes to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   xata branch apply
   ```

This will:
- Validate your schema changes
- Apply the changes to your feature branch
- Show you a preview of the changes

### 4. Test your changes

Your application can now connect to the feature branch and test the changes:
   ```bash
   xata branch url
   ```

Use the URL to connect your application to the feature branch.

### 5. Deploy to production

When you're ready to deploy:

1. Merge your changes to main:
   ```bash
   xata branch merge main
   ```

2. Apply the changes to production:
   ```bash
   xata branch apply
   ```

## Best practices

1. **Create small, focused branches**: Each branch should represent a single feature or fix
2. **Test thoroughly**: Use the feature branch to test your changes before merging
3. **Keep branches up to date**: Regularly merge changes from main to avoid conflicts
4. **Use meaningful branch names**: Make it clear what each branch is for
5. **Clean up old branches**: Delete branches after they're merged

## Common commands

- **Delete branches**: `xata branch delete <branch-name>`
- **Get branch URL**: `xata branch url`
- **List branches**: `xata branch list`
- **Switch branches**: `xata branch checkout <branch-name>`
- **View branch status**: `xata branch view`
