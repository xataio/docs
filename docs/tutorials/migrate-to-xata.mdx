title: Tutorial – migrate an existing database to Xata
description: Step-by-step guide for moving data from any PostgreSQL service to Xata with minimal downtime
---

Migrating to Xata is straightforward because the platform speaks pure PostgreSQL wire-protocol. You can start with a one-time dump/restore and, if you need *near-zero downtime*, finish the cut-over with real-time replication powered by our open-source project [**pgstream**](https://github.com/xataio/pgstream).

---

## 1. Choose a migration strategy

| Strategy | Downtime | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Snapshot** – `pg_dump` → `pg_restore` | requires a maintenance window equal to dump + upload time | personal projects, non-critical services, small (< 50 GB) databases |
| **Continuous streaming** – snapshot + [**pgstream**](https://github.com/xataio/pgstream) logical replication | seconds | production workloads that cannot tolerate extended read-only periods |

Regardless of the option you pick, the first step is identical: create a database branch in Xata that will receive the data.

```bash
# create a dedicated migration branch so you can test safely
xata branch create migrate-prod

# grab the connection URL
export XATA_MIGRATE_URL=$(xata branch url --branch migrate-prod)
```

---

## 2. One-time snapshot with `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`

1. Dump your existing database (source Postgres, RDS, CloudSQL, etc.):
   ```bash
   pg_dump \
     --format=directory \
     --jobs=4 \
     --no-owner \
     --dbname=$SOURCE_DATABASE_URL \
     --file=/tmp/pgdump
   ```
2. Restore into the Xata branch:
   ```bash
   pg_restore \
     --jobs=4 \
     --clean \
     --if-exists \
     --dbname=$XATA_MIGRATE_URL \
     /tmp/pgdump
   ```
3. Validate data counts and run application smoke-tests against the branch.
4. Promote the branch to **main** (or switch your app's `DATABASE_URL`) once satisfied.

> **Tip:** Large objects & extensions are included automatically because Xata runs unmodified Postgres.

## 3. Near-zero-downtime migration with [**pgstream**](https://github.com/xataio/pgstream)

If you run a 24×7 service or the dump window is too long, use [**pgstream**](https://github.com/xataio/pgstream) to replicate changes while users keep writing to the source database.

### 3.1. Install pgstream

```bash
go install github.com/xataio/pgstream/cmd/pgstream@latest
```

### 3.2. Prepare the source database

Ensure **logical replication** is enabled:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 10;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

Create a replication user:

```sql
CREATE ROLE pgstream REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
```

### 3.3. Run the initial snapshot + streaming

```bash
pgstream \
  --source $SOURCE_DATABASE_URL \
  --target $XATA_MIGRATE_URL \
  --slot pgstream_slot \
  --create-snapshot
```

The tool first copies a consistent snapshot (similar to `pg_basebackup`) and then switches to logical decoding to stream ongoing changes.

You can monitor progress with:

```bash
pgstream status --slot pgstream_slot --source $SOURCE_DATABASE_URL
```

### 3.4. Cut over

1. Stop writes on the source (e.g. put the app in maintenance mode).
2. Wait for `pgstream` lag to reach **0 bytes**.
3. Point the application to the Xata branch URL and resume traffic.
4. Shut down `pgstream` and decommission the old cluster.

Downtime is limited to the seconds it takes to restart the application.

---

## 4. Post-migration housekeeping

* **Apply [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) migrations** – initialise roll on the new database with `xata roll init`.
* **Enable anonymised staging branches** – `xata clone --anonymize` for preview environments.
* **Set up GitHub Actions** – see the [check merge readiness workflow](/github-actions/check).
