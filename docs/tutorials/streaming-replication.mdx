title: Set up streaming replication
description: Use Xata's streaming replication to keep your database continuously synchronized with real-time changes.
---

This guide shows you how to set up continuous streaming replication from your production PostgreSQL database to Xata, enabling real-time data synchronization with optional anonymization.

![Setting up streaming replication to Xata](assets/images/xata-streaming-replication.png)

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Xata account ([sign up here](https://console.xata.io))
- The [Xata CLI](/cli) installed:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://xata.io/install.sh | bash
  ```
- A PostgreSQL database with:
  - Logical replication enabled
  - A dedicated replication slot (or permissions to create one)
  - Network connectivity from Xata to your database

## 2. Enable logical replication on source database

First, ensure your source PostgreSQL database has logical replication enabled. You'll need to set these parameters:

```sql
-- Check current settings
SHOW wal_level;
SHOW max_replication_slots;
SHOW max_wal_senders;
```

If not already configured, update your PostgreSQL configuration:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 10;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_senders = 10;
```

Restart your PostgreSQL instance for the changes to take effect.

## 3. Create a Xata project and branch

In the Console, create a new project and then click the **Create main branch** button to create the PostgreSQL instance.

For streaming replication, consider using at least 1 replica to ensure high availability during continuous synchronization. Select an instance size that can handle your expected write throughput.

> **Note:** Streaming replication maintains a persistent connection to your source database. Ensure your network allows stable, long-lived connections between Xata and your PostgreSQL instance.

## 4. Configure the Xata CLI

Authenticate the CLI by running:

```sh
xata auth login
```

Initialize the project by running:

```sh
xata init
```

Select the project and branch you created in the previous step. This will create a `.xata` folder with configuration files.

## 5. Create a replication slot

Create a dedicated replication slot on your source database:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('xata_replication', 'pgoutput');
```

This slot will track changes in your database for streaming to Xata.

## 6. Configure streaming replication

Generate a configuration for the streaming process:

```bash
xata clone config --source-url $CONN_STRING --mode=prompt
```

Where `CONN_STRING` is your PostgreSQL connection string with replication permissions.

The configuration prompt will ask you to:
- Select tables to replicate
- Configure anonymization rules if needed
- Set up transformation pipelines

This creates a configuration file at `.xata/clone.yaml` that you can further customize.

## 7. Initialize and start streaming

First, initialize the streaming setup with an optional initial snapshot:

```bash
xata clone stream --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --init \
  --replication-slot xata_replication \
  --snapshot-tables "public.*"
```

This command will:
- Create an initial snapshot of your specified tables
- Set up the streaming pipeline
- Begin continuous replication

For production deployments, you can run the stream command without `--init` if you've already performed an initial snapshot:

```bash
xata clone stream --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --replication-slot xata_replication
```

## 8. Monitor streaming status

The streaming process runs continuously, keeping your Xata database synchronized with changes from the source. Monitor the streaming status by checking the logs:

```bash
xata clone stream --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --replication-slot xata_replication \
  --log-level debug
```

## 9. Advanced configuration

### Filtering specific tables

To stream only specific tables, use the `--filter-tables` flag:

```bash
xata clone stream --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --replication-slot xata_replication \
  --filter-tables "users.*,orders.*,products.*"
```

### Custom transformations

Edit your `.xata/clone.yaml` file to add custom transformations:

```yaml
transforms:
  - table: users
    columns:
      - name: email
        transformer: mask_email
      - name: phone
        transformer: redact
  - table: orders
    columns:
      - name: credit_card
        transformer: mask_credit_card
```

### Running with Docker

For production deployments, consider running the streaming process in a containerized environment:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name xata-stream \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v $(pwd)/.xata:/config \
  xata/cli clone stream \
  --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --config /config/clone.yaml \
  --replication-slot xata_replication
```

## 10. Handling failures and recovery

If the streaming connection is interrupted, the replication slot ensures no data is lost. Simply restart the streaming command:

```bash
xata clone stream --source-url $CONN_STRING \
  --replication-slot xata_replication
```

The process will resume from where it left off, catching up with any changes that occurred during the downtime.

## Summary

- You now have real-time streaming replication from your PostgreSQL database to Xata
- Changes in your source database are automatically synchronized
- Your data can be anonymized in transit using configurable transformers
- The replication slot ensures no data loss during network interruptions
