description: Learn how to safely apply and roll back schema changes in Xata using the CLI.
---

This guide shows you how to safely apply and roll back schema changes in Xata using the CLI. You'll use the `xata roll` commands to manage migrations, and an example with changing column types.

To better understand the use case and our novel approach to the challenge of schema changes, see the [schema changes core concept](/core-concepts/schema-changes) page for more details.

`xata roll` is embedding [pgroll](https://pgroll.com) behind the scenes and additional details around schema changes can be found in the [pgroll documentation](https://pgroll.com/docs/latest).

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Xata account ([sign up here](https://console.xata.io))
- The [Xata CLI](/cli) installed:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://xata.io/install.sh | bash
  ```
- Access to your Xata PostgreSQL branch (connection string)
- An initialized Xata project and branch

## 2. Create a Xata project and branch

In the Console, create a new project and then click the **Create main branch** button to create the PostgreSQL instance.

Since this is a production setup, we recommend using at least 1 replica. It's a good idea to start with a similar instance size as you are running in your current PostgreSQL provider. You will be able to adjust it later.

## 3. Configure the Xata CLI

Authenticate the CLI by running:

```sh
xata auth login
```

Initialize the project by running:

```sh
xata init
```

You would typically run `xata init` command in your application source directory, or in any directory/repository where you'd like to keep the configuration. It will create a `.xata` folder with several configuration files.

Follow the instructions from the prompt to select the project and branch that you created at the previous step.

## 4. Prepare a migration directory

Create and initialize a directory for your migrations (e.g., `.xata/migrations`) using the following command:

```sh
xata roll init
```

This command sets up migration tracking on your current Xata branch and prepares the directory for your migration files.

## 5. Create initial tables

First, let's create some sample tables using the SQL from our [getting started guide](/getting-started). Connect to your database using psql:

```sh
psql `xata branch url`
```

Then run the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,name TEXT,price NUMERIC(7,2));
CREATE TABLE orders(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now());
CREATE TABLE order_items(order_id INT REFERENCES orders(id),product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),qty INT,PRIMARY KEY(order_id,product_id));
INSERT INTO products(name,price) SELECT LEFT(md5(i::text),8),(random()*90+10)::numeric(7,2) FROM generate_series(1,10)i;
WITH o AS (INSERT INTO orders DEFAULT VALUES RETURNING id) INSERT INTO order_items(order_id,product_id,qty) SELECT o.id,pid,(1+floor(random()*3))::int FROM o,(SELECT id pid FROM products ORDER BY random() LIMIT 5)p;
```

## 6. View and pull changes

You can view the changes in your branch details page in the [Xata Console](https://console.xata.io). The changes will be tracked automatically.

To pull the latest migrations locally, run:

```sh
xata roll pull
```

This will update your local migration files with any changes made to your database.

## 7. Create a new schema change

Let's create a migration that:
1. Changes the `qty` column in the `order_items` table from integer to float
2. In the `up` function (current schema → new schema):
   - Converts any quantity less than 1 to 1.0
   - Converts all other values from integer to float
3. In the `down` function (new schema → current schema):
   - Uses the column value directly for rollback

Create the migration file with this command:

```sh
cat > .xata/migrations/001_alter_order_items.yaml << 'EOL'
operations:
  - alter_column:
      table: order_items
      column: qty
      type: float
      up: |
        CASE 
          WHEN qty < 1 THEN 1.0
          ELSE qty::float
        END
      down: qty
EOL
```

## 8. Apply the migration

Apply the migration using:

```sh
xata roll migrate
```

This command applies the migration but leaves it uncompleted and allows you to roll back if needed.

> **Note:** If you need to start a specific migration instead of applying all pending ones, you can use `xata roll start`. See the [CLI reference](/cli/roll) for more details.

To test rolling back, let's run this command:

```sh
xata roll rollback
```

To test completing a migration, let's run the migration command again:

```sh
xata roll migrate
```

We can check the migration status to see if it has started:

```sh
xata roll status
```

To finalize the migration, let's complete it:

```sh
xata roll complete
```

In a production scenario, you would only complete the migration when the application code is up to date with the database changes.

## 9. (Optional) Add to CI/CD with GitHub Actions

To automate schema changes in your CI/CD pipeline, you can use our GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow creates a dedicated Xata branch for each pull request, allowing you to test database changes in isolation.

For details about setting up the workflow and available configuration options, see our [GitHub Actions PR workflow documentation](/github-actions/pr).

## 10. Summary

- Use `xata roll migrate` to apply the latest migration
- Use `xata roll rollback` to undo migrations if needed
- Use `xata roll complete` to finalize migrations when your application is ready
- For more details on up/down migrations, see the [pgroll documentation](https://pgroll.com/docs/latest).
- See the [CLI reference](/cli/roll) for all available `xata roll` commands.
