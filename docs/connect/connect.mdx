# Connect to Xata

Every connection to Xata ultimately uses the standard PostgreSQL wire protocol, so you can reuse the drivers you already know. The high-level flow is always the same:

1. **Get a connection string for the branch you want to work with**  
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL=$(xata branch url --branch main)
   ```  
   The generated URL already embeds SSL settings and a passwordless access token if you are logged-in via the CLI.
2. **Pass `DATABASE_URL` to your language, framework or ORM**  
   Most drivers read the variable automatically; others take it as a constructor argument.

> **Tip:** Xata enforces TLS. Make sure `sslmode=require` (or `verify-full`) is present when using raw libpq strings.

Xata provides multiple ways to connect to your databases, whether you're using a specific programming language, framework, or ORM.
