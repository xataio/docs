# GitHub Actions

Xata provides several GitHub Actions workflows to help you automate database operations in your CI/CD pipeline. These workflows help you manage database branches, migrations, and deployments in a safe and automated way.

## Available Workflows

### [Ensure Main is Ready for Merge](./github-actions/check.mdx)

This workflow validates that the main branch is in a ready state for merging pull requests. It checks the migration status and ensures no pending migrations are running that could affect the merge process.

Key features:
- Validates main branch status
- Checks migration state
- Prevents merging during active migrations
- Provides clear status messages

### [Create Xata Dev Branch](./github-actions/pr.mdx)

This workflow creates a dedicated Xata branch for each pull request, allowing you to test database changes in isolation. It also manages PR comments to provide branch information and status updates.

Key features:
- Creates isolated database environments for PRs
- Manages branch lifecycle
- Handles migrations automatically
- Provides connection details in PR comments

### [Xata Clone Workflow](./github-actions/clone.mdx)

This workflow helps you clone your database on a schedule or manually trigger it. It's useful for creating regular backups or setting up test environments.

Key features:
- Scheduled database cloning
- Manual trigger support
- Backup management
- Test environment setup

## Common Features

All workflows share some common features:

### Authentication

Each workflow requires a Xata API refresh token, which should be stored as a GitHub secret:

```yaml
XATA_API_REFRESH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.XATA_API_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
```

### Environment Variables

Common environment variables used across workflows:

- `XATA_API_ENVIRONMENT`: The Xata environment to use (e.g., staging)
- `XATA_ORGANIZATIONID`: Your Xata organization ID
- `XATA_PROJECTID`: Your Xata project ID
- `XATA_BRANCHID`: The ID of the main branch
- `XATA_BRANCHNAME`: The name of the main branch
- `XATA_DATABASENAME`: Your database name

### Concurrency Control

All workflows use GitHub Actions concurrency to prevent multiple runs from interfering with each other:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Store sensitive information in GitHub secrets
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

2. **Performance**
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Use concurrency control
   - Optimize workflow triggers

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep workflows up to date
   - Monitor workflow runs
   - Review and update dependencies

4. **Documentation**
   - Document workflow changes
   - Keep README files updated
   - Include clear error messages
