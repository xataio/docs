## Request an extension

**Need an extension we don't have?** ðŸ“© [Request an extension](https://xata.canny.io/xata-postgres-extensions)

We're always looking to expand our extension offerings. If you need an extension that's not currently available, please let us know through our feature request portal. We'll review your request and respond there.

## Getting help

If you need help with a specific extension, we recommend checking the official documentation linked in the table above. For general PostgreSQL extension support, you can also refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/).

If you run into an issue or discover a bug with an extension, we recommend reporting it to the extension's upstream maintainers. If a fix is released, we're happy to update to the latest version of the extension.

For additional support, you can also [contact our support team](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Custom extensions

We don't actively maintain third-party extension code, but we're happy to help you get the extensions you need. If you require a custom extension that's not listed above, we encourage you to [contact our support team](https://support.xata.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to discuss.

### BYOC for custom extensions

If you need to install custom extensions that aren't available in our standard offering, consider our [Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model](/docs/deployment#bring-your-own-cloud-byoc). This allows you to run the entire Xata dataplane in your own Kubernetes cluster, giving you full control over which extensions are installed and configured.
