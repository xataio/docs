description: Sample GitHub Actions workflows and Kubernetes files for Xata
---

Xata provides several sample GitHub Actions workflows and Kubernetes configurations to help you automate database operations in your CI/CD pipeline. These workflows help you manage database branches, migrations, and deployments in a safe and automated way.

## Sample GitHub Actions workflows

### [Check merge readiness](./automations/ga-check)

This workflow validates that the main branch is in a ready state for merging pull requests. It checks the migration status and ensures no pending migrations are running that could affect the merge process.

### [Create Xata dev branch](./automations/ga-pr)

This workflow creates a dedicated Xata branch for each pull request, allowing you to test database changes in isolation. It also manages PR comments to provide branch information and status updates.

### [Xata clone workflow](./automations/ga-clone)

This workflow helps you clone your database on a schedule or when you manually trigger it. It's useful for setting up a "staging replica", optionally with anonymization, on the Xata platform.

## Sample Kubernetes specifications

### [Xata clone CronTask](./automations/kubernetes-clone)

This defines a CronTask that clones your database on a schedule or when you manually trigger it. It's useful for setting up a "staging replica", optionally with anonymization, on the Xata platform.
