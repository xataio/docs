---

Migrate your existing PostgreSQL databases to Xata's platform using `xata clone`. This tool efficiently copies data between PostgreSQL instances, supporting both one-time migrations and continuous replication.

## What is xata clone?

[`xata clone`](/cli/clone) is a powerful tool for copying data between PostgreSQL instances efficiently. You can use it to import your existing database (from RDS, Cloud SQL, Supabase, etc.) into Xata with optional data anonymization for staging & development environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any migration:

1. **Source Database Access**: You need the connection string (host, port, database name, user, password) of the source database
2. **User Privileges**: The user should have sufficient privileges to read data
4. **Network Access**: Ensure your environment can reach the source database
5. **Xata Project**: Create a Xata account and project with a target branch
