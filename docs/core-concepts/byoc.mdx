description: Deploy Xata's PostgreSQL platform in your own cloud environment
---

Deploy Xata's PostgreSQL platform in your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account while maintaining full control over your infrastructure and data.

## Architecture

![BYOC Architecture](/assets/images/byoc-architecture.png)

*BYOC Architecture: Control plane managed by Xata, data plane deployed in your cloud account*

### Control Plane

The Xata control plane manages:
- User authentication and authorization
- Project and organization management
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and restore operations
- Schema migration management

### Data Plane

The data plane runs in your cloud account:
- PostgreSQL instances on Kubernetes
- Distributed storage system
- Network and security configuration
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup storage

## Implementation

### Kubernetes Integration

Xata uses CloudNativePG operator for PostgreSQL management:
- High availability via synchronous replication
- Read replicas for scaling
- Automatic failover
- Rolling updates
- Backup management

### Storage System

The platform uses a distributed storage system:
- NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) for high performance
- Erasure coding for data resilience
- Node-level redundancy
- Automatic failover
- Unlimited storage growth

## Deployment Options

### Cloud Providers

- **AWS**: EKS, EC2, EBS
- **Azure**: AKS, VMs, Managed Disks
- **GCP**: GKE, Compute Engine, Persistent Disks
- **Hetzner**: Self-managed Kubernetes

### Infrastructure Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (1.20+)
- 3+ nodes for high availability
- NVMe storage support
- Network connectivity to control plane
- IAM/Service Principal configuration

## Security

### Data Protection

- Data never leaves your cloud account
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network isolation via VPC/VNet
- IAM integration for access control
- Audit logging

### Compliance

- GDPR compliance
- HIPAA compliance
- SOC 2 compliance
- Custom compliance requirements
- Data residency controls

## Getting Started

1. Set up Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
# AWS
eksctl create cluster --name xata-cluster

# Azure
az aks create --name xata-cluster

# GCP
gcloud container clusters create xata-cluster
```

2. Configure Xata deployment:
```bash
xata init --byoc
```

3. Deploy Xata platform:
```bash
xata deploy
```
