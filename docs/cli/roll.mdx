The `roll` commands help you manage PostgreSQL schema migrations using pgroll, providing zero-downtime schema changes and rollbacks.

## complete {#complete}

Complete an ongoing migration.

```bash
xata roll complete
```

This command finalizes a migration that was started with `roll start`, applying all pending changes to the database.

## init {#init}

Initialize pgroll in the target database.

```bash
xata roll init
```

This command sets up the necessary pgroll infrastructure in your database, including:
- Creating required tables
- Setting up triggers
- Initializing the migration tracking system

## latest {#latest}

Print the name of the latest schema version.

```bash
xata roll latest
```

This command shows the most recent schema version, either from:
- The target database
- A local migration directory

## migrate {#migrate}

Apply outstanding migrations to the database.

```bash
xata roll migrate
```

This command applies all pending migrations from your local migration directory to the target database.

## pull {#pull}

Pull migration history from the target database.

```bash
xata roll pull
```

This command retrieves the migration history from the target database and writes it to your local migration directory.

## rollback {#rollback}

Roll back an ongoing migration.

```bash
xata roll rollback
```

This command reverts a migration that was started with `roll start` but not yet completed.

## start {#start}

Start a new migration.

```bash
xata roll start <file>
```

Arguments:
- `file` - The migration file containing the schema changes

This command begins a new migration using the specified migration file.

## status {#status}

```

This command displays the current state of pgroll, including:
- Active migrations
- Pending changes
