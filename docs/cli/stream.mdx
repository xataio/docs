description: Commands for managing logical streaming replication operations
---

The stream command helps you manage database streaming operations with `pgstream`, using logical replication.

## Subcommands

### destroy

Destroy any pgstream setup, removing the replication slot and all the relevant tables/functions/triggers, along with the internal pgstream schema.

```bash
xata stream destroy --source-url <url> [--config <file>] [--log-level <level>] [--postgres-url <url>] [--replication-slot <name>] [-h|--help]
```

- `--source-url`: The source URL of the database to clone (required)
- `--config`: .env or .yaml config file to use with pgstream if any
- `--log-level`: Log level for pgstream (trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal|panic, default: info)
- `--postgres-url`: Source postgres URL where pgstream destroy will be run
- `--replication-slot`: Name of the postgres replication slot to be deleted by pgstream from the source url
- `-h, --help`: Print help information and exit

## Global Flags

- `-h, --help` - Print help information and exit
- `--json` - Output in JSON format
