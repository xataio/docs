description: Deep technical dive into Xata's PostgreSQL platform architecture

# Overview

Xata delivers "Postgres at scale" by combining a globally hosted control-plane with a data-plane that can be either hosted by Xata or deployed in your own cloud. The platform brings together three core building blocks:

1. **A cloud-native storage layer** that separates storage from compute and enables instant Copy-on-Write (CoW) branching.
2. **Vanilla PostgreSQL on Kubernetes** orchestrated by **CloudNativePG (CNPG)** for high availability, rolling upgrades, and self-healing.
3. **A developer-centric workflow** powered by open-source projects **pgstream** (replication & data masking) and **pgroll** (zero-downtime schema changes).

## 1. High-Level Architecture

| Layer | Responsibilities | Runs in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Control plane** | Web UI, API, auth, organizations & projects metadata | Xata cloud (multi-region) |
| **Data plane – compute** | PostgreSQL instances, read replicas, backups, pgroll workers | Xata cloud (standard) or Customer cloud (BYOC) |
| **Data plane – storage** | Distributed NVMe/TCP storage cluster (Simplyblock) | Xata cloud (standard) or Customer cloud (BYOC) |

In the standard Xata architecture, both the control plane and data plane are hosted and managed by Xata in our cloud infrastructure. This provides a fully managed experience with automatic scaling, backups, and maintenance.

## 2. Storage Layer – Distributed, Bottomless, NVMe/TCP

![Compute Kubernetes cluster and storage cluster](/assets/images/k8s-and-storage.png)

Xata provides a software-defined storage cluster that exposes logical NVMe volumes to Postgres pods via NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF). Key characteristics:

* **Separation of storage & compute** – grow each independently; no need to over-provision disks.
* **Erasure coding at node level** – parity data is distributed across nodes, allowing multiple node failures with minimal overhead.
* **NVMe-oF multipathing** – every volume has multiple active paths; I/O is transparently rerouted on node failure.
* **User-space I/O via SPDK/DPDK** – bypassing the kernel reduces latency and context switches.
* **Bottomless storage billing** – pay per-GB-month for only the bytes actually in use.

### 3. Copy-on-Write Branching

CoW happens **inside the storage layer**. Creating a branch copies only the metadata index; data blocks are duplicated lazily on first write.

The branching process involves several steps:

1. **Metadata Copy**: Only the metadata index is copied, which contains pointers to data blocks
2. **Lazy Block Duplication**: Data blocks are duplicated only when modified
3. **Write Tracking**: Modified blocks are tracked to maintain branch isolation
4. **Block Sharing**: Unmodified blocks are shared between branches to save space

Benefits:

* Instant branch creation (milliseconds)
* Minimal extra disk usage – only changed blocks are duplicated
* Works on multi-TB databases because no full copy is required
* Efficient storage utilization through block sharing

## 4. Compute Layer – Kubernetes & CloudNativePG

We run **unmodified PostgreSQL** inside Kubernetes pods managed by **CloudNativePG**. CNPG handles:

* Synchronous or asynchronous replication
* Automated fail-over & self-healing
* Online minor-version upgrades
* Continuous, base + incremental backups to object storage
* Read-replica management and connection pooling

Because Postgres is unmodified, **all extensions work** out-of-the-box. You can request additional extensions and Xata will validate & enable them quickly.

### 4.1 Developer Workflow Components

#### pgstream – Replication & Data Masking

* Logical replication stream augmented with **in-flight masking transforms**
* Detects and anonymizes PII/PHI based on configurable transformers
* Powers `xata clone` to build **staging replicas** and keep them in sync

The replication process:
1. Captures changes from the source database
2. Applies masking transforms in-flight
3. Replicates to target database
4. Maintains consistency through transaction boundaries

#### pgroll – Zero-Downtime Schema Changes

* Generates migration plans that can be **rolled forward or rolled back**
* Uses dual-schema execution so reads/writes work during migrations
* Integrated into `xata roll` commands & GitHub Action workflows

Migration workflow:
1. Create a new schema version
2. Apply changes to new schema
3. Migrate data in batches
4. Switch to new schema
5. Clean up old schema

### 4.2 CI/CD & GitHub Actions

* **Ensure Main is Ready for Merge** – blocks PRs if pending migrations exist
* **Dev Branch per PR** – automatically `xata branch create` & tear-down
* **Nightly Clone** – scheduled `xata clone` to refresh anonymized staging data

## 5. Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

![BYOC control plane and data plane](/assets/images/byoc-architecture.png)

For customers who need to keep their data within their own cloud infrastructure, Xata offers the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model. In this model:

* The control plane remains hosted by Xata
* The entire data plane (Postgres pods, storage nodes, pgstream/pgroll workers) is deployed inside your VPC
* Deployment is handled via Terraform or Helm charts provided by Xata
* The control plane communicates via outbound-only gRPC over TLS
* You maintain full network control and can leverage your existing cloud infrastructure

Security highlights:

* **No inbound ports** need to be opened
* All data remains within your cloud account – meets strict compliance requirements
* Leverage existing **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** for cost reductions
