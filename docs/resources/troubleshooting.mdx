## General Questions

### What is Xata?
Xata is a PostgreSQL platform that provides instant Copy-on-Write branching, data masking, and separation of storage from compute. It's designed for teams running PostgreSQL at scale, offering features like zero-downtime schema changes, realistic staging environments, and cloud-agnostic deployment options.

### Is Xata production ready?
Yes, Xata is production-ready with features like high availability, automatic backups, and monitoring. The platform is built on proven technologies including CloudNativePG for PostgreSQL management and Simplyblock for distributed storage.

### Do you offer a free tier?
Yes, we offer a free tier for development and testing. Contact us for details about the current free tier offerings.

### What about a free trial?
We offer a free trial period for all paid plans. Contact us to get started with your trial.

## Staging & Development

### How does Xata handle staging environments?
Xata creates a "staging replica" that combines Copy-on-Write branching with data anonymization. This allows you to:
- Create instant dev branches from the staging replica
- Work with realistic, anonymized versions of your production data
- Test schema changes safely before applying them to production

### Will Xata alter my production database?
No, your production database stays exactly as it is. Xata works with your existing PostgreSQL service, whether it's AWS RDS, Amazon Aurora, GCP CloudSQL, Azure Database, or self-hosted Postgres.

### How do ephemeral environments improve development speed?
By providing instant Copy-on-Write branches, developers can:
- Work in isolation without waiting for others
- Test changes against realistic data
- Avoid conflicts with other developers
- Quickly create and destroy environments as needed

### Can I test complex schema changes with Xata?
Yes, you can use `xata roll` (powered by pgroll) to test schema changes and safely apply them with zero-downtime to production. This allows you to test complex changes in isolation before applying them to production.

## Data Privacy & Security

### How does data anonymization work?
Xata uses `pgstream` to copy and anonymize data on the fly. The system:
- Detects and masks PII/PHI and sensitive data
- Maintains referential integrity
- Preserves data relationships
- Allows configurable transformers for different data types

### Is my data secure in staging environments?
Yes, Xata ensures data security by:
- Automatically anonymizing sensitive data
- Maintaining strict access controls
- Providing audit trails
- Supporting compliance requirements (SOC-2, HIPAA, GDPR)

### Can I keep my data within my own infrastructure?
Yes, through our Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model, you can run the full Xata platform in your own cloud account or on-premises, ensuring data never leaves your infrastructure.

## Performance & Storage

### How does Xata's storage system work?
Xata uses a distributed storage system that:
- Separates storage from compute
- Uses NVMe/TCP for high performance
- Implements erasure coding for data resilience
- Provides automatic storage growth
- Charges only for actual storage used

### Can Xata help with performance tuning?
Yes, Xata provides the Xata Agent, an LLM-powered tool that helps:
- Monitor PostgreSQL instances
- Diagnose performance issues
- Optimize queries
- Tune PostgreSQL settings
- Analyze active queries and statistics

### Do you charge for bandwidth?
No, we don't charge for bandwidth. You only pay for compute and storage resources.

## Deployment & Integration

### Can I bring my own cloud infrastructure?
Yes, Xata offers a Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model that allows you to:
- Deploy in your own AWS, GCP, or Azure account
- Run on-premises if needed
- Maintain full control over your infrastructure
- Use your cloud provider's credits and discounts

### Can Xata integrate with CI/CD pipelines?
Yes, Xata integrates with:
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins
- Other CI/CD systems
- Custom automation workflows

### Do I need to modify my existing database schema for Xata?
No, Xata works with your existing PostgreSQL schema. You can start using Xata's features without any schema modifications.

## Pricing & Plans

### Are all anonymization features and zero-downtime schema changes free?
Yes, these features are included in both Pay As You Go and BYOC plans.

### Is there a minimal number of nodes for the BYOC model?
Yes, BYOC requires a minimum of 3 nodes for high availability. Contact us for specific requirements.

### Do you offer instances with different CPU/RAM ratios?
Yes, we can customize instance configurations. Contact us to discuss your specific needs.

### Can I use Xata for white-labeling?
Yes, we offer white-labeling options for PaaS providers. Contact us to discuss partnership opportunities.

## Technical Details

### How does Copy-on-Write branching work?
Xata's Copy-on-Write branching:
- Creates instant branches without copying data
- Only copies modified chunks when writes occur
- Maintains data integrity across branches
- Provides significant disk space savings
- Enables fast branch creation and deletion

### What PostgreSQL extensions are supported?
Because we run vanilla PostgreSQL, we support:
- All standard PostgreSQL extensions
- Custom extensions
- Community extensions
- We can quickly approve and deploy new extensions as needed

### How does the storage system achieve high performance?
The storage system:
- Uses SPDK and DDPK for user-space operations
- Implements NVMe-oF multipathing
- Provides distributed parity data
- Enables fault tolerance across the cluster
- Minimizes latency and context switches
